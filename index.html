                    As a <strong>Freelance Friendly</strong> organisation, we are continually striving to work well with external independent workers for our mutual benefit, and aim to uphold the following principles:

                        <p>We recognise the value of working with external independent workers - providing us with capabilities and people we wouldn’t otherwise be able to access - and the impact they bring to the growth and success of our business. We see external independent talent as our extended team - not just overflow or outsourcing, but a way to bring in fresh thinking, diverse skills, and deep expertise to support and accelerate our work.</p></div>

                        <p>We will pay fair market rates for our freelancers services, never ask for free work or pay contingent on a client paying us, and will pay invoices on or before the due date. No payment terms will be longer than 30 days. Day rates and project fees will be revised over time to reflect increasing costs of living and value of experience.</p></div>
